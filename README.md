# leaflet-experiments

Web mapping experiments using [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/).

Also check out my [Esri experiments](https://github.com/jwasilgeo/esri-experiments) and other data visualizations on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jwasilgeo/).

## [Aviation Tracker](https://jwasilgeo.github.io/leaflet-experiments/aviation/)

### Read more about it at [**FlowingData: Aviation tracker with depth**](https://flowingdata.com/2017/09/15/aviation-tracker-with-depth/)

[![screenshot of Aviation Tracker](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwasilgeo/leaflet-experiments/master/aviation/aviation-tracker-screenshot.png)](https://jwasilgeo.github.io/leaflet-experiments/aviation/)

- Aircraft tracking data provided by **The OpenSky Network, <https://www.opensky-network.org>**

- [Leaflet.ParallaxMarker (jwasilgeo fork)](https://github.com/jwasilgeo/Leaflet.ParallaxMarker): parallax layer originating from [@dagjomar's](https://github.com/dagjomar) awesome [Leaflet.ParallaxMarker](https://github.com/dagjomar/Leaflet.ParallaxMarker)

- [Leaflet.Terminator](https://github.com/joergdietrich/Leaflet.Terminator): solar terminator layer

- [Esri Leaflet](https://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/): Esri gray basemap layer and geocoder widget

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/): "plane" icon used for the parallax layer symbol

## [Night and Day](https://jwasilgeo.github.io/leaflet-experiments/night-and-day/)

- The Suomi-NPP VIIRS "Earth at Night" layer is clipped by using [Leaflet.Terminator](https://github.com/joergdietrich/Leaflet.Terminator) in combination with [TileLayer.BoundaryCanvas](https://github.com/aparshin/leaflet-boundary-canvas).

- [SunCalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc), [Turf.js](http://turfjs.org/), [spacetime](https://spencermountain.github.io/spacetime/), and [spacetime-geo](https://spencermountain.github.io/spacetime/) are used for reporting the local time and sun positions.

## [Lerc Imagery Land Cover Layer](https://jwasilgeo.github.io/leaflet-experiments/lerc-landcover/)

[![screenshot of Lerc Imagery Land Cover Layer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwasilgeo/leaflet-experiments/master/lerc-landcover/lerc-landcover-screenshot.png)](https://jwasilgeo.github.io/leaflet-experiments/lerc-landcover/)

- Demonstration of rendering a [2020 global land cover map](https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d6642f8a4f6d4685a24ae2dc0c73d4ac) (produced by Impact Observatory for Esri) hosted as an ArcGIS ImageServer in tiled LERC format as 8bit color-coded pixels.

- **Inspired heavily by [@jgravois's](https://github.com/jgravois)** earlier research on tying together LERC decoding within a LeafletJS `GridLayer`. <https://github.com/jgravois/lerc-leaflet>

- LERC imagery tile data are read with Esri's [Limited Error Raster Compression](https://github.com/Esri/lerc/) JavaScript decoder.

- Check out this [Esri Community thread](https://community.esri.com/t5/esri-leaflet-questions/how-to-diagnose-error-rendering-esri-2020-land/m-p/1079790) and [GitHub `esri-leaflet` discussion](https://github.com/Esri/esri-leaflet/issues/726) for more info.

## [Esri-Leaflet and Chart.js](https://developers.arcgis.com/esri-leaflet/samples/dynamic-chart/)

<https://developers.arcgis.com/esri-leaflet/samples/dynamic-chart/>

> Plot feature attributes on a dynamic chart that updates as users pan and zoom, and respond to chart interactions by modifying feature layer contents.
